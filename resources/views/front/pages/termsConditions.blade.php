                    <p>We have made every effort to visualize, as accurately as possible, the colours and textures of the fabrics which appear on our website. However, the colours and textures which you effectively see will vary depending on your monitor settings and video card. Therefore we cannot guarantee that they will be faithfully visualized.

                    <h3>4. Measurements and styles</h3>
                    <p>All our  garments are manufactured on the basis of the measurements and indications which you provided. You may choose from among the following options:</p>
                    <p>
                        <ul class="letter-ul">
                            <li>Provide us with your body measurements.</li>
                            <li>Provide us with the measurements of a shirt whose size you particularly like.</li>
                            <li>Opt for a standard size.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <ul class="letter-ul">
                            <li>In the first case, centimetres of fabric will be added depending on the type of fitting you have chosen. The accuracy of the measurements provided by you is obviously extremely important in terms of the final results. Please ensure that you have entered the correct data before placing your order.</li>
                            <li>If you decide to supply us with the measurements of a shirt which you already own, you will receive a shirt of identical size as the original. However, please note that we generally cannot guarantee that the style and cut will be identical. The shirt's appearance obviously depends also on the other stylistic elements which you chose.</li>
                            <li>The standard measurements refer to the collar size of the finished shirt. For example, if your neck circumference is 40 cm, widened by a couple of centimetres for comfort, then your size would be 42. Supreme Sifu's sizes, available from 37 to 49, refer to the average European body build. </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Two shirts ordered at different times may vary slightly. This is because we are continuously committed to improve the style and the design of our shirts, which may therefore change over time concerning their particulars. But also because the same fabric colours may vary slightly, since modern dyeing techniques mean that different bolts of material may have slight variations in colour shades.
