                            <p>Long long back there were two energetic young men with dreams to be the best tailors in their country. They both wanted to be masters in their crafts. Quite coincidentally they both were from the small  town of Malacca in Malaysia. </p>
                            <p>While one of them concentrated on the concept of tailoring on traditional gentleman’s outfit through skills is acquired under the training of the famous Sifu Weng Yew from Singapore. The other concentrated in the concept of tailoring on new and modern styles of outfit designing through skills he acquired from his long lineage of tailoring family and from the tried and tested family formulas.</p>
                            <p>Both now a master at their trades setup their tailoring shops in Malacca, in the early 1930’s. Both business grew simultaneously at an exponential rate. A friendly competition evolved between the two masters. People in Malacca considered it to be a prideful thing to wear cloths tailored by these masters. Each tailor tried to devise strategies and techniques to beat each other constantly. Unknowing to them both were evolving to be the greatest tailors in the country. Students started to come from all over Malaysia to learn the crafts from the masters. </p>

                            <p>The young boy now was entrusted with the task to learn the generations of skills passed down from both families and to develop a refined method to the art of tailoring. Working and researching further into the science he constantly tried to incorporate methods and techniques from around the world to help his business further. He made trips all around the world to understand how traditional tailors work in each of these places as each tailor have a different method and formulas which they seldom hand down to people other than their own. The convinced each of these masters to teach more about them and their methods at the same to helping them to understand his ideas and achievements. </p>

                            <p>Researching further the boy was very disturbed about the fact that the newer generation was not able to benefit from these traditional tailors. Youngster were no longer wearing perfect fitting cloths. He finally understood that this was due to the marketing by big clothing corporations that made one size that fits all clothing limiting the people from getting the best fit cloths. More than that youngsters were hugely dependent up on online shopping for cloths and most of them were not happy with what they were buying as 70% of times the cloths won’t fit them perfectly as the models  in the website images. </p>
