While we try to accurately display the colors of our products on the Website, the actual colors you see depend on your monitor and settings of your screen, and we thus cannot guarantee that the colors displayed by your monitor will be exactly the same color of the product at the time of delivery and / or receiving: </p>
                <ul class="shirt-care-ul">
                    <li>The variations in manufacturing processes, the settings of your monitor and your computer hardware can affect fabrics and product designs, which means that the delivered products may be slightly different in appearance to those shown and described on the Website;</li>
                    <li>All products / fabrics of <b>Supreme-Sifu</b> are subject to availability, which means that we cannot always deliver the order.

                    <li>The original garments should be returned to our quality control center. Customers are responsible for return shipping charges.</li>
